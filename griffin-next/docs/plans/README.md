# Griffin × Atlas — improvement sprint (Phase 0: plans)

Branch: `sprint/griffin-atlas-polish`. This directory holds one plan doc per workstream.
Each plan: **Current state · What's broken/missing · Proposed change · Risks · Acceptance criteria**.
Investigation-heavy workstreams (CI, compute, sandboxing) are findings-first.

Nothing irreversible ships without owner sign-off — **sandboxing (10) is design-only pending a go/no-go**.

**Workstream 12** is signed off and in progress. All four open decisions are resolved in the plan: lineage DAG ships first; vocabulary promotion is hybrid (auto at 10 distinct nodes, plus maintainer override); `db verify` runs in CI against a committed fixture; and the Python CLI **does** share the database, read-only against versioned views with TypeScript owning every migration. Phases 0 (build spike) and 1 (characterization tests) are complete — see *Implementation findings* in the plan.

Status: 🔎 exploring · 📝 plan drafted · 🚧 implementing · ✅ done · ⛔ blocked on owner decision.

## Landed so far (implementation)

- **Urgent hang fix** — every Atlas call (bridge + client) is now timeout-bounded, so `griffin project init` (run every session by the research prompt) and the per-command sync probe can't wedge a session for 60 min.
- **WS1 — CI determinism ✅** — tests seed a committed models.dev catalog fixture (zero network); the live delisting check moved to a nightly `catalog.yml` job. **855 pass / 0 fail**, deterministic. (Coverage — WS1-B — grows alongside each feature workstream.)
- **WS2 — Codex login 🚧** — hardened the OAuth flow (HTTP timeouts, port-in-use fallback, device-poll deadline, refresh that retries transient 5xx but only says "reconnect" on a real 4xx), clean error surfacing + headless device fallback, and made **"Sign in with ChatGPT (Codex)" a first-class option in the wizard picker** (it was previously unreachable there). Remaining: the managed-proxy P0 — the backend actually _consuming_ the pushed Codex tokens — needs the token-owner decision.

Next: WS3 (sync billing-flip + atomic writes).

## Notes at kickoff

- **CI is already green** on `main` — the previously-flaky live-catalog tests were fixed by #91/#92. Workstream 1 is now hardening + coverage on the paths this sprint touches, not firefighting.
- The settings surface already ships `Spend`, `Usage`, `Storage`, `Compute` panels with backing routes — workstream 8 is surfacing/wiring a wallet view, not building from scratch.
- **Phase 0 exploration is complete — all 11 plans are drafted.** Next: check in with the owner on sequencing + the open decisions, then implement workstream by workstream.
- Atlas managed compute: the `atlas compute:*` CLI suite (Modal sandboxes + reseller GPUs → `/api/compute/leases`) **exists in the published 0.13.2**, but Griffin pins `@griffin/atlas@^0.5.12` — a version-alignment gap, not a missing feature (see [06](06-compute-integrations.md)).
- **No isolation exists today** — the default permission policy is `"*": "allow"`, so in-project `bash`/`edit`/`webfetch` run unprompted (see [10](10-agent-sandboxing.md), design-only, needs sign-off).
- **Open question for the owner:** whether to make real Atlas-repo changes this sprint (parallel branch + its own PR) or document them for your team, since Atlas is the production backend. Per-workstream plans flag where an Atlas-side change is required.
